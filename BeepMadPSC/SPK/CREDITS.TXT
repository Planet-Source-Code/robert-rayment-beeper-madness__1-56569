     This diskette of music files in .SPK format  owes a lot of credit to a
     bunch  of  dedicated  music  fans   throughout   the  world  who  have
     laboriously written  files  (usually  BASIC  programs)  to  play these
     songs.  The music on  this  disk  has  generally  been translated from
     their original efforts to a format suitable for use by the DRVSPKR.SYS
     loudspeaker device driver.

     In many cases, the  original  music  program (acquired through public-
     domain distribution channels) does  not  contain the identification of
     the original author.  When it does,  I  am grateful to acknowledge the
     efforts of the originator of the music program here.

     This list is not complete.  Many of  the songs on the diskette contain
     no credits of any kind.  To their  authors (as well, of course, to the
     writers of  the  original  songs:   they  could  certainly  never have
     imagined their work presented in  such  a  fashion!) let me express my
     thanks.

     Similarly, if you have BASIC programs  that play music which you would
     like to contribute towards  this  collection,  please  send  it to me:
     Gordon E.  Peterson II,  Noah  Systems,  P.O.  Box 40476, San Antonio,
     Texas 78229-1476. If possible, I will convert it to DRVSPKR format for
     the collection, and for  the  enjoyment of others.  Non-BASIC-programs
     are of course welcome too!

     There is also a conversion program, called PLAYCVT, which is available
     should you wish to  convert  music  or  other  PLAY statement data for
     yourself.  Contact me at the above address for further details.

     The programs credited below to  Neil  J. Rubenking have generally been
     produced with  his  excellent  music  recording  and  editing program,
     PIANOMAN.  My conversion program PLAYCVMS  converts his Superkey macro
     files into my .SPK format.
